## Description

_This is my first solo project where I created an online portfolio linking to all the fun projects I did this week. It is an overview of HTML, Block Elements, Inline Elements, Git, Tracking, Committing, Command Line, and Spacing. Also included is a short About Me section._

## Known Bugs

_I tried to include a Google Font but so far it is not working. Also spun around and around on card height for awhile. Still haven't quite gotten spacing fixed. Could not figure out how to make Jumbotron responsive. Found out and implemented jumbotron-fluid at bottom and is somewhat responsive?_
